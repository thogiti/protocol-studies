## Pre-reading

Before the program, you should be familiar with some general concepts from Ethereum and computer science. If you are not familiar with basics of using Ethereum or have non experience with software development, we recommend gaining at least some understanding of following:

- Cryptography
    - Hashing
    - Public key cryptography
- Data structures
    - Merkle trees
- Networking, p2p and distributed systems
- Software development basics
    - Programming languages, compilers
- Ethereum as a platform
    - From a user perspective
    - As a dapp developer

These are just general suggestions of domain knowledge you will need. More introductory learning resources can be found in [week 1](/eps/week1.md).
