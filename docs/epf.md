# Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF)

The Ethereum Protocol Fellowship (EPF) is a program designed to provide developers and researchers with a 
structured environment to contribute directly to Ethereum core protocol. The fellowship offers participants 
mentorship, learning opportunities, and hands-on experience working on some of the most pressing technical 
challenges in Ethereum.

## Why EPF?

Ethereum’s core protocol development is a highly specialized and rapidly evolving field. EPF helps onboard 
and support the next generation of protocol contributors by providing:

- **Access to core development community** – Work alongside Ethereum’s top researchers and engineers.
- **Real-world experience** – Contribute to open issues in Ethereum’s execution and consensus layers.
- **Choose your project** – No fixed curriculum, just deep technical engagement.
- **Permissionless participation** – The door is wide open.
- **Funding support** – Some fellows receive stipends to focus on the program.

## Past Cohorts & Resources

Each EPF cohort has produced meaningful contributions to Ethereum’s roadmap. You can explore past work and

## How to Get Involved

The best way to get involved is to start contributing to Ethereum’s protocol discussions and codebase. Follow these steps:

1. **Join the Ethereum R&D Discord** – Engage with the community and ask questions. [Discord Invite](https://discord.gg/ethereum)
2. **Follow Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs)** – Read and discuss active proposals on [EthMagicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/) and [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch/).
3. **Explore good first issues** – Make your first contributions via [Good First Issues](https://gfi.bordel.wtf).
4. **Apply for the next EPF cohort** – Keep an eye out for announcements on the [Ethereum Foundation Blog](https://blog.ethereum.org).

EPF isn’t just about writing code—it’s about becoming a core part of Ethereum’s long-term development. If you’re passionate about advancing Ethereum’s protocol, this is the best way to get started.
